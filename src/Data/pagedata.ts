    pt1: "A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. It is not only used for organizing data but also for processing, retrieving, and storing it. There are different types of data structures that can be used depending on the needs of the program or software system",
    pt2: "Data structures are important because they allow you to store and retrieve data in an efficient manner. They can help improve the performance of your code by reducing the time and space complexity of algorithms. They also provide a way to organize and store data in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and storage of data. Data structures are also essential for managing and manipulating data in an efficient and effective way. They are a fundamental concept in computer science and are used extensively in programming and software development",
    pt3: `There are many real-life applications of data structures. For example: Databases use data structures such as trees, heaps, and hash tables to store and retrieve data efficiently. Operating systems use data structures such as lists, queues, and stacks to manage tasks, processes, and memory. Web search engines use data structures such as inverted indexes and tries to index and search the web efficiently. Computer graphics use data structures such as binary trees, octrees, and meshes to represent and manipulate 3D objects.`
